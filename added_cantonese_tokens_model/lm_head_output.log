nohup: ignoring input
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /scratch/s5600502/thesis_project/mandarin_cantonese/cantonese-tokenized-wav2vec2-model and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- lm_head.weight: found shape torch.Size([3970, 1024]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3503, 1024]) in the model instantiated
- lm_head.bias: found shape torch.Size([3970]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3503]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
vocab_size: 3970
lm_head weight shape: torch.Size([3970, 1024])
lm_head bias shape: torch.Size([3970])
